<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hyperphosphatemia Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Phosphate Binder</li><li>Iron Phosphate Binder</li><li>Magnesium Phosphate Binder</li><li>Calcium Phosphate Binder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hyperphosphatemia drugs market types include aluminum phosphate binders, iron phosphate binders, magnesium phosphate binders, and calcium phosphate binders. Aluminum phosphate binders work by binding with phosphorus in the stomach and preventing its absorption. Iron phosphate binders also function similarly by binding with phosphorus in the gastrointestinal tract. Magnesium phosphate binders help lower phosphorus levels in the blood by enhancing its excretion. Calcium phosphate binders bind with dietary phosphorus in the intestine, reducing its absorption in the body.</p></p>
