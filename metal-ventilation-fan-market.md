<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Ventilation Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metal ventilation fans are available in two main types: axial and centrifugal. Axial fans are designed with blades that rotate around an axis, creating airflow parallel to the fan axis. They are best suited for applications where large volumes of air need to be moved at low pressures, such as cooling electronic equipment. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, use a rotating impeller to create airflow perpendicular to the fan axis. They are ideal for applications requiring higher pressures, such as HVAC systems in buildings.</p></p>
