<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self expandable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Memory Alloy</li><li>Non Memory Alloy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-expandable stents are medical devices used to treat narrow or blocked blood vessels. There are two main types of self-expandable stents: memory alloy and non-memory alloy. Memory alloy stents are made of materials that can return to their original shape after being deformed. Non-memory alloy stents, on the other hand, do not have this ability and rely on external forces for expansion. Both types of stents are used in the treatment of various conditions such as heart disease and peripheral arterial disease.</p></p>
