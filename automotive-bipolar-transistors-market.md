<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Bipolar Transistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>NPN</li><li>PNP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Bipolar Transistors come in two main types - NPN and PNP. NPN transistors are the most commonly used type and have a positive-negative-positive configuration. They allow current to flow from the collector to the emitter when a small current is applied to the base. On the other hand, PNP transistors have a negative-positive-negative configuration and allow current to flow from the emitter to the collector with a small current applied to the base. Both types are essential components in automotive electronics for controlling and amplifying signals.</p></p>
