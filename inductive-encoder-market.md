<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inductive Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental</li><li>Absolute</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inductive encoders are devices used to convert mechanical motion into electrical signals. There are two main types of inductive encoders: incremental and absolute. Incremental encoders provide information about the amount and direction of movement, but they do not provide an absolute position. On the other hand, absolute encoders provide a unique digital code for each position, allowing for precise positioning without the need for a reference point. Both types of encoders are commonly used in various industries such as manufacturing, robotics, and automotive.</p></p>
