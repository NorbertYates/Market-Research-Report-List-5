<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thyristor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional Thyristor</li><li>Bidirectional Thyristor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thyristors are electronic devices used for controlling large amounts of electrical power. There are two main types of Thyristors, Unidirectional and Bidirectional. Unidirectional Thyristors can conduct current in only one direction, making them suitable for applications like rectification and power control. On the other hand, Bidirectional Thyristors can conduct current in both directions, making them useful for applications requiring bidirectional power flow control, such as AC voltage regulation and motor speed control. Each type of Thyristor has its own specific market based on its unique capabilities and applications.</p></p>
