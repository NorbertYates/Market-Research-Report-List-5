<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two Wheeler Anti-lock Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-channel ABS</li><li>Multi-channel ABS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-channel ABS is a type of anti-lock braking system that controls the braking force on only one wheel. This system is usually cheaper and simpler to implement, making it popular in entry-level bikes and scooters. On the other hand, multi-channel ABS controls the braking force on both wheels independently, providing better stability and control during emergency braking situations. This system is commonly found in high-end motorcycles and offers superior performance compared to single-channel ABS.</p></p>
