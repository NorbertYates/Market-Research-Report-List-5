<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Home Solar Energy Storage Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Coupled Solar Battery</li><li>DC-Coupled Solar Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC Coupled Solar Battery refers to a system where the solar panels generate DC electricity, which is converted into AC electricity using an inverter. This AC electricity is then used to charge the battery storage system. DC Coupled Solar Battery, on the other hand, refers to a system where the solar panels directly charge the battery storage system with DC electricity. Both types of systems allow homeowners to store excess solar energy for later use, reducing reliance on the grid and saving money on electricity bills.</p></p>
