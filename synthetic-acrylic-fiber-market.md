<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Acrylic Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Synthetic Acrylic Fiber market can be segmented into two main types: Wet Spinning and Dry Spinning. Wet Spinning involves dissolving the acrylic polymer in a solvent and extruding it through spinnerets into a coagulating bath to form fibers. Dry Spinning, on the other hand, involves dissolving the polymer in a solvent with low boiling point, spinning it into fibers, and then evaporating the solvent to solidify the fibers. Both methods have their own advantages and are commonly used in the production of acrylic fibers.</p></p>
