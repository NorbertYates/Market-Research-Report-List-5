<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Metal Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Very Low Frequency</li><li>Pulse Induction</li><li>Beat-frequency Oscillation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital metal detector market is segmented into three main types based on technology: Very Low Frequency (VLF), Pulse Induction, and Beat-frequency Oscillation. VLF detectors operate by emitting electromagnetic fields and detecting changes when metal objects are present. Pulse Induction detectors send short bursts of current through a coil, generating a magnetic field that responds to metal objects. Beat-frequency Oscillation detectors use two coils to generate a frequency that changes when a metal object is detected. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses for different metal detecting applications.</p></p>
