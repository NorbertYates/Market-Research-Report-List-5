<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Gas Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive airbag inflators are categorized into three main types: Pyrotechnic Gas Inflator, Hybrid Gas Inflator, and Stored Gas Inflator. Pyrotechnic Gas Inflators use a small amount of pyrotechnic material to generate gas for inflating the airbag rapidly in a controlled manner. Hybrid Gas Inflators combine the features of both gas and pyrotechnic inflators for a balanced inflation process. Stored Gas Inflators store compressed gas in a chamber which is released upon impact to inflate the airbag. Each type has its own advantages and suitability for different applications.</p></p>
