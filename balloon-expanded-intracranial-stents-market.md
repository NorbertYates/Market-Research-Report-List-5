<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expanded intracranial stents are used to treat conditions such as intracranial stenosis. Open-loop stents have a flexible design that allows for better conformability to the vessel walls, reducing the risk of restenosis. Closed-loop stents, on the other hand, have a more rigid structure that provides greater support and stability to the vessel lumen. Each type of stent has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific needs of the patient and the geometry of the blood vessel being treated.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expanded intracranial stents are used in the treatment of both ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. In the context of ischemic stroke, these stents help restore blood flow to the brain by opening up narrowed or blocked blood vessels. In the case of hemorrhagic stroke, they are used to reinforce weakened blood vessel walls and prevent further bleeding. The market for these stents is driven by the rising incidence of strokes and the increasing adoption of minimally invasive procedures for stroke treatment.</p></p>
