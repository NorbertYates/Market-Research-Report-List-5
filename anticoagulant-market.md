<p><strong>The Anticoagulant Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DVT</li><li>PE</li><li>AF</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anticoagulants are commonly used to prevent or treat conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and atrial fibrillation (AF). DVT results from blood clotting in the veins, potentially causing serious complications if left untreated. PE occurs when a blood clot travels to the lungs, posing a risk of life-threatening consequences. AF is a heart condition that increases the risk of stroke due to abnormal heart rhythm. Anticoagulants help to prevent these conditions by inhibiting blood clot formation.</p></p>
