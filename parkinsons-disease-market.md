<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parkinson`s Disease Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carbidopa/Levodopa</li><li>Dopamine Receptor Agonists</li><li>MAO-Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Parkinson's Disease market is divided into three main types: Carbidopa/Levodopa, Dopamine Receptor Agonists, and MAO-Inhibitors. Carbidopa/Levodopa is the most common treatment for Parkinson's and works by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine Receptor Agonists mimic the effects of dopamine in the brain, while MAO-Inhibitors work by blocking an enzyme that breaks down dopamine. Each type of treatment targets different aspects of the disease's symptoms and can be used alone or in combination to manage Parkinson's symptoms.</p></p>
